      <description>This weekend I learned a bit about what goes into putting a house together. The biggest take away was that making sure all the pieces are square and level is critical, and saves a lot of time down the road.
For instance: there were two mud sills, or sill plates, on the foundation walls. The original plan was to shim the second course of sill so that it was totally level all the way around the foundation.</description>

      <description>Do not rely on the fact that go unmarshaled json without error into your type - it may just have ignored all the json and instantiated an empty variable.</description>

      <description>TIL that I can use git add --edit during an interactive rebase to do things like move a file from a go package (created in that commit) to an existing package; this reduces the scope of the regex substitution to avoid changing unrelated code.</description>
